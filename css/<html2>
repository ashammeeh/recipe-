<h1> Traditional Stuffed Grape Leaves </h1>
<p> Stuffed grape leaves is a traditional dish that originates from the Middle East. Referred to as “warak dawali” in Arabic, the dish calls for grape leaves stuffed with spiced rice and finely ground beef. The leaves are then to be cooked in a pot with traditionally, tomatoes, and stuffed zucchinis at the bottom, and to be flipped when served. </p>
